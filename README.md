## Hey, I'm Jethro. ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior full-stack developer currently working for [Minttwist](https://www.minttwist.com/) in London, United Kingdom. 

My go-to technologies include [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) but I am also a firm believer in keeping it simple, utilizing regular HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as much as possible. 

I recently started my journey into Web 3.0 and I am currently learning [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). ðŸŒ±

When I have time I write blog posts on my personal website [jethromay.com](https://jethromay.com).

If you would like to reach out, its best to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jethromayuk).
